                I'm a 2A Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for software. Most recently, I worked as a software developer at [Universe Projects]("https://www.universeprojects.com/"), where I designed and implemented features for their video game, Voidspace. In the past, I was a software development intern at [NYTEC](http://nytec.org), where I built and deployed their library system software.
