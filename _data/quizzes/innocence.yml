- title: The Innocence Test
  description: >
    fun fact (actually really, really sad fact), the Rice Purity Test was made in the 80s. that means that it includes none of the quintessential 21st century rebellious activities (think sexting, fake IDs and tinder). welcome to a two best friends' re-imagining of the classic purity test, we hope you have as much fun as we did. NOTE: The Innocence Test is not a bucket list, nor do we endorse the behaviors listed below.
