						<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system" class = "paragraph">Lindenmayer systems</a> are mathematical systems for rewriting strings. By repeatedly applying rules to replace characters with other characters, a string of characters can be interpreted as a set of instructions for a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics" class = "paragraph">turtle</a>. This Javascript project demonstrates this concept by implementing turtle graphics and Lindenmayer systems with easily adjustable parameters. A variety of graphical controls implemented using HTML and Javascript allow the user to change the visual representation of the L-system's resultant string, while the rules for variable replacement and the definitions for interpreting the variables are generated dynamically from user input.

						BlockGame is a block-based 2D sandbox Java game. It generates a world made of different blocks using a mathematical formula, and dynamically saves and loads different parts of the world based on the position of the player. The different blocks use object-oriented programming to allow more blocks to be easily added to the game in the future. The player is also written using object-oriented programming to simplify the process of adding more entities to the game.
					</p><p>
						A simple physics engine was written to simulate the player's collisions with the environment. The physics engine implements vector-based bounding-box collision detection, which is optimized by only checking blocks along the player's movement trajectory. The entire game is written as a discrete time simulation, using multithreading to allow for simultaneous entity movement, world interaction, and graphics calculations.

						DeltaT is an embedded systems project. It is a reaction time game written in C++ and implemented using the
						<a href = "https://onion.io/Omega2/" class = "paragraph">Onion Omega 2</a>
						Linux system on a chip. It consists of a row of LEDs on a breadboard which light up in sequence. The goal of the game is to press a button when the middle light is lit up. Doing this correctly increments the player's score and speeds up the pace of the game. Since this is an embedded system, software was written to write the state of the system into a log file at various points throughout the game. This allowed for troubleshooting issues with the hardware and the software.
					</p><p>
						A system was also implemented to keep track of player statistics and write them to a data file. Infrastructure for interfacing with the hardware via the Onion Omega 2's GPIO pins was designed so that inputs could be read from the button, and so that the state of the game could be shown on the LEDs. Since this was a time-based game and the Onion Omega 2 system did not have an easily usable clock, the C++ time.h header file was used to design an interface to enable time-dependent code execution.

						Molecularize is an object-oriented Java library for performing chemical calculations. It allows for the representation and serialization of chemical data, calculates molar masses of elements and compounds based on their chemical formulas, and provides exceptions for handling invalid data. It currently also features representations of quantities and units, and automatic unit conversion is planned for the future.
